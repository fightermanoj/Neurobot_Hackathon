# Neurobot_Hackathon

Production Visibility System created for the MSME Hackathon at IIT Palakkad.

This application helps ABC Powder Food Processing track their production line in real-time. It replaces manual logs with a digital system. Workers use voice commands to update batch status as they move through stations like Grinding and Packing.

The system includes:
- A Python FastAPI backend for processing data and voice inputs.
- A React frontend with dashboards for owners and managers.
- Real-time alerts and worker tracking.

Currently running in demo mode with in-memory storage for easy testing without external database dependencies.
